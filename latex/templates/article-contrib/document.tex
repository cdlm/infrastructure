In this context...

P is a problem because...
We propose this solution...
Our solution solves P in such and such way.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Context

Problem

Known tracks for solutions

What our solution is (the reader knows where the paper is going)

Paper structure


\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:problem}

Context, exposed with the \textbf{most precise terms possible} (don't open
unwanted doors for the reader)

Constraints that influenced the solution (because the solution is not
universal) \emph{e.g.} our requirements for a solution, possibly not all
satisfied. They should be sound and believable. Analysis of the criteria.

Problem

Factual solution tracks, to position...
Our solution in a nutshell.


\section{Proposed Solution}
\label{sec:contribution}

Free form, variable number of sections, technical details.


\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

Discussion of actual solution \emph{vs.} initial constraints from
\ref{sec:problem}. Explain the space of the solution, why we made it this way.

Evaluation of the solution. How does the solution meet the criteria? Where
does it succeed or fails...


\section{Related Works}
\label{sec:related}

Other solutions in the domain, and a real comparison of our contribution with
solutions from other people.


\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we looked at problem P with this context and these
constraints. We proposed solution S. It has such good points and such not so
good ones. Now we could do this or that.
